## General Information
- Bike Sharing Provider BoomBikes wants to understand the factors that affect the the number of Rides. Based on the results, BoomBikes wants to define strategies to run the business into profits.
- Problem Statement
	Find out the factors/variables that affect demand for bikes
	Build model that estimate demand for given set of data for identified variables
- Datasets used: 
	Bike Sharing Dataset, that contains the daily number of Rides and other details for the years 2018 and 2019.
	
## Conclusions
- From the model parameters, it is understood that the Casual drives, Working Day (indicates business day), and the year (year by year increase) are contributing positive significantly towards the demand of the shared bikes
- The Linear Regression model perfectly fits for this objective, as the data target variable count of Rides is linear to the other independent variables like Weather condition, seasons, etc.
- It’s clearly evident that Spring has a lesser number of rides compared with the other three seasons
- And the “Fall” season has highest number of rides compared with the other three seasons
- And the number of rides are increased year by year across all the weather conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.11.5
- Pandas - 2.0.3
- matplotlib - 3.7.2
- seaborn - 0.12.2
